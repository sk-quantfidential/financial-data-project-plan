| Component | Technology Choice | 
| Frontend | Next.js (REST API for MVP, optional GraphQL for advanced filtering) | 
| UI Backend | Rust service, REST API (initial), optional gRPC/GraphQL, OAuth2 auth | 
| Messaging | ProtoBuf schemas for all services; gRPC for sync workflows; Kafka for async; NATS optional | 
| Persistence | PostgreSQL, schema derived from ProtoBuf; AI-assisted migrations | 
| Batch & Async Tasks | Rust + Tokio for orchestration and monitoring | 
| Containerization | Docker (auto-generated containers via CI/CD) | 
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions / GitLab CI / similar, with Docker build/push | 
| Observability | Prometheus + Grafana | 
| Authentication | OAuth2 | 
| Reconciliation | Sign-posted for Day 2 (external/internal data integrity checks) | 



⚠️ Remaining Decisions / Risks
- ProtoBuf-to-REST tooling: You’ll need a reliable way to generate RESTful JSON and HTML from ProtoBuf schemas. Tools like  or  can help, but integration with Rust may need custom wrappers.
- GraphQL integration: Consider using  in Rust if you go that route.
- AI-assisted migrations: This is emerging tech—tools like Prisma or sqlc may help, but AI integration will likely need custom scripting or Copilot-style workflows.
- Schema evolution: You’ll need a versioning strategy for ProtoBuf schemas to avoid breaking changes across services.

🚀 Smart Tech Delivery Roadmap
Phase 1: MVP Foundation (Weeks 1–4)
Goal: Deliver a working charting frontend with REST API and real-time data ingestion.
- ✅ Define core ProtoBuf schemas for financial data (e.g., tick, candle, metadata)
- ✅ Build Rust UI backend with REST API using axum or actix-web
- ✅ Implement OAuth2 authentication (e.g., oauth2 crate or Auth0)
- ✅ Set up PostgreSQL schema based on ProtoBuf definitions
- ✅ Build Next.js frontend with charting (e.g., using react-chartjs-2)
- ✅ Create Kafka-based ingestion service in Rust (Tokio + rdkafka)
- ✅ Set up CI/CD pipeline with Docker auto-builds
- ✅ Add Prometheus metrics to backend; Grafana dashboard
Phase 2: Async & Batch Expansion (Weeks 5–8)
Goal: Add real-time ingestion, long-running task orchestration, and internal messaging.
- 🔄 Add gRPC endpoints to backend for tightly coupled workflows
- 🔄 Build batch job runner using Tokio tasks (e.g., daily summary, cleanup)
- 🔄 Add NATS-based internal PUB/SUB if needed (e.g., for cache invalidation)
- 🔄 Implement ProtoBuf-to-REST tooling (e.g., grpc-gateway or custom)
- 🔄 Add GraphQL endpoint for advanced filtering (optional)
- 🔄 Begin AI-assisted migration tooling (e.g., schema diff + SQL generation)
Phase 3: Resilience & Reconciliation (Weeks 9–12)
Goal: Harden the system and prepare for external data reconciliation.
- 🛡 Add retry, circuit breaker, and timeout logic to async workflows
- 🛡 Implement schema versioning and compatibility checks
- 🛡 Build reconciliation service skeleton (external vs. internal data)
- 🛡 Add alerting rules in Prometheus (e.g., ingestion lag, auth failures)
- 🛡 Document schema evolution and API contracts
